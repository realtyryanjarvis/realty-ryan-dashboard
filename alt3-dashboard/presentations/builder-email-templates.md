## Email 1: Initial Introduction

**Subject:** Smart homes for your buyers — quick intro

---

[First Name],

I've been following what you're building in Charlotte — impressive work.

I'm Ryan Palmer with Alt3 Smart Homes. We design and install fully integrated smart home systems — lighting, sound, shading, security — for luxury new construction.

We're currently working with builders in the $1M+ space, and I wanted to share what we're doing:

**→ [See what we offer builders](https://realtyryanjarvis.github.io/alt3-dashboard/presentations/builder-intro.html)**

The short version: we handle everything from design to install to post-sale support. Your buyers get a turnkey smart home on closing day. You get a competitive edge, higher margins, and zero tech callbacks.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call or a quick tour of one of our completed projects?

Best,
Ryan Palmer

[First Name],

Just circling back — wanted to make sure this didn't get buried.

Here's a quick look at what an Alt3 home looks like for the buyer:

**→ [Client experience preview](https://realtyryanjarvis.github.io/alt3-dashboard/proposals/1240-paddock/client-experience.html)**

We're doing a project now with Keen Building that includes full Lutron HomeWorks lighting, Josh.ai voice control, whole-home audio, and motorized shading — all programmed and ready before closing.

Happy to walk you through the numbers on what this looks like per home. Most builders are seeing $50K-$200K in upgrade revenue they weren't capturing before.

Worth a conversation?

## Email 3: Value Add (10 days later)

**Subject:** 72% of luxury buyers expect this

---

[First Name],

Quick stat: 72% of luxury home buyers now expect smart home features (NAR). Homes with integrated smart systems sell 5% faster and at higher prices.

The builders offering it are winning more buyers. The ones who aren't are answering the question "does this home have smart features?" with "no."

We make it simple to be the builder who says yes — one partner, one system, one phone number for you and your buyer.

**→ [See the full builder program](https://realtyryanjarvis.github.io/alt3-dashboard/presentations/builder-pitch.html)**

I'd love to buy you a coffee and walk through what a partnership looks like. No pitch — just showing you what we're building.
