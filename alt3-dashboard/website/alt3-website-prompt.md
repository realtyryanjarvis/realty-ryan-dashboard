## BRAND VOICE THROUGHOUT:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Sophisticated but approachable
- Technical when needed, lifestyle-focused always
- Short sentences. Bold statements. Let the work speak.
- Never say "smart home" without showing why it matters to *their* life
- Avoid: "cutting edge," "state of the art," "revolutionary" — use: "intuitive," "integrated," "seamless," "effortless"
