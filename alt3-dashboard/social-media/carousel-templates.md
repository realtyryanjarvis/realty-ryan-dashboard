### Slide 1 — Cover
- **Background:** Full-bleed editorial photo — framed house under construction, golden hour light
- **Overlay:** Navy semi-transparent bar across bottom third
- **Text:** "5 Things Your Builder Won't Tell You About Smart Homes" — Neue Montreal Bold, cream #E1D8CE
- **Subtext:** "Swipe →" — Neue Montreal Light, taupe #BEB1A2
- **Logo:** Alt3 in white, bottom right

### Slide 2
- **Background:** White #FFFFFF
- **Layout:** Large number "01" in navy #113665 (oversized, top-left). Body text right-aligned.
- **Headline:** "Pre-wiring costs 10x less than retrofitting."
- **Body:** "The walls are open right now. Running low-voltage wire during framing costs $3–5K. Retrofitting the same after drywall? $30–50K+. This is the single biggest money-saving decision you'll make."
- **Accent:** Taupe #BEB1A2 thin line divider below text

### Slide 3
- **Background:** Navy #113665
- **Layout:** Large "02" in taupe. Text in cream.
- **Headline:** "Not all 'smart home packages' are equal."
- **Body:** "Most builder smart home packages include a ring doorbell, a Nest thermostat, and some recessed lights on dimmers. That's not a smart home. That's a starter pack. Ask what's actually included — and what's missing."

### Slide 4
- **Background:** White #FFFFFF
- **Layout:** Large "03" in navy. Editorial photo strip across top third (lighting design plan on table).
- **Headline:** "Your lighting plan should come before your electrical plan."
- **Body:** "Most builders have the electrician place lights and switches. Then you're stuck with that layout forever. A lighting designer + integrator specs scenes, zones, and control FIRST — then the electrical follows."

### Slide 5
- **Background:** Navy #113665
- **Layout:** "04" and "05" stacked.
- **Headline 1:** "An integrator should be at the table from day one."
- **Body 1:** "Not called after move-in. Not brought in at trim. From schematic design — alongside your architect and builder."
- **Headline 2:** "The right system adds real home value."
- **Body 2:** "$50K–$150K in perceived value. Appraisers and buyers notice."
- **Bottom bar:** "→ alt3smarthomes.com | info@alt3.com" in taupe
